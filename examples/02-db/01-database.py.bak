# In this example, we'll build a mini-store:
# with products, customers and orders.
# We can combine the data from the three tables in an invoice query.

# Create a new database. 
# Once it is created, you can use Database(name) to access it.
# SQLite will create the database file in the current folder.
# MySQL databases require a username and a password.
# MySQL also requires that you install MySQLdb, see the installation instructions at:
# http://www.clips.ua.ac.be/pages/pattern-db
db = Database("store.db", type=SQLITE)
#db._delete()

# PRODUCTS
# Create the products table if it doesn't exist yet.
# An error will be raised if the table already exists.
# Add sample data.

    # Note: in SQLite, the STRING type is mapped to TEXT (unlimited length).

# Create the customers table and add data.

# Create the orders table if it doesn't exist yet and add data.

# Show all the products in the database:
print "There are", db.products.count(), "products available:"
for row in db.products.rows():
    print row

# Note how the orders table only contains integer id's.
# This is much more efficient than storing entire strings (e.g., customer address).
# To get the related data, we can create a query with relations between the tables.

# The XML can be passed to Database.create() to create a new table (with data).
